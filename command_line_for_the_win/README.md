Command Line For The Win

This Project was first to test our grasp of 
basic cshell commands and intermediate scripting ability.

The next phase of the challenge came as an introduction to SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol).
Then associate that knowledge to the FTP (File Transfer Protocol).

I achieved this in the followinmg ways:
	- SFTP on my local terminal
	- uploading files with the put command 
	- This was after I listed  the available commands with "?'
	- Next I SSH into the online terminal
	- Moved my screenshots into the stated repo
	- Next pushed to github
